The first thing I did was clean up the html and css. The html used all <div> elements. I added header, nav, and footer elements to make the html easier to follow. The main image if the page was in the css and not the html. Because it was in the css file I was not able to add the alt attribute to make it accessible. Once that was added, I added alt attributes to all pictures and icons. In the css I moved the elements and classes under comments that corresponded with their respective styles.
